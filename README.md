This sample (formerly the Kendo UI DataViz app template) shows how to use Telerik AppBuilder and the mobile and data visualization widgets of Kendo UI Professional to develop a hybrid mobile app with rich HTML5-based data visualization. The app provides a pie chart, a stock chart, a gauge and a QR code generator.

## Telerik AppBuilder and Kendo UI Professional

> **IMPORTANT:** Telerik AppBuilder does not provide Kendo UI Professional with this sample. You need to manually include it in your project. For more information, see [Running the Sample].<br/>If you decide to add Kendo UI Professional to your project via the built-in package manager, keep in mind that Telerik AppBuilder provides a customized Kendo UI Professional package. The customized package contains widgets and framework features for mobile development and rich data visualization.

AppBuilderâ„¢ is an Integrated Cloud Environment (ICE) that eliminates the complexity associated with cross-platform mobile development. By combining the convenience of a local development environment with the power and flexibility of the cloud, AppBuilder lets you build hybrid mobile apps for multiple mobile platforms. For more information, see the [Telerik AppBuilder web page].

Kendo UI is a UI framework that provides everything you need to build sites and apps with pure JavaScript and HTML5. Kendo UI Professional is a Kendo UI suite that provides over 70 widgets and framework features to let you create apps with rich data visualization. For more information, see the [Kendo UI web page].

## Sample Overview

This sample shows you how to implement a native-looking user interface along with the unique Flat UI. The app provides a pie chart, stock chart, gauge, and a QR code generator. This sample was formerly available as the **Kendo UI DataViz** and the **Kendo UI mobile app with data visualization** templates in AppBuilder.

This sample shows how to use the following widgets and features of Kendo UI Professional:

* **[Application]**: The widget provides the necessary tools for building native-looking web based mobile applications.
* **[RadialGauge]**: The widget lets you quickly determine where a value lies in a range. Kendo UI draws the gauge using SVG.
* **[Chart]**: The widget draws high quality charts of the following types: bar, column, line, area, bullet, pie, donut, scatter, bubble, radar, and polar. Kendo UI draws the chart using SVG.
* **[QRCode]**: The widget generates canvas or SVG images that represent QR codes. Kendo UI draws the QR code using SVG.
* **[StockChart]**: The widgets lets you visualize stock prices and related graphs. Kendo UI draws the QR code using SVG.
* **[DataSource]:** The DataSource component is an abstraction for using local data (array of JavaScript objects) or remote data (web service returning JSON, JSONP, OData or XML). 

For more information about the Kendo UI Professional widget APIs, see the [Kendo UI API Reference]. 

This sample shows how to use the following Apache Cordova core plugins:

* **[Splashscreen]:** The plugin shows or hiders the splashscreen when the app launches.
